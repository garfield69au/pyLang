Description: # pyduq
        
        pyduq [py = python, d=data quality, uq = University of QLD, Australia]
        
        This project is a generic, meta-driven data quality validation suite. This project
        was developed by Shane J. Downey as parr of his M.Phil research study. 
        
        The purpose of pyduq is to provide a detailed analysis of the quality of data by
        comparing actual data against a set of generic data quality rules. The data quality 
        rules are an implementation of LANG. LANG is a prior research study that provided
        a set of data quality pseudo-SQL statements that implement the 8 dimensions of 
        data quality.
